=============
ckanext-ab_process_state
=============

This extension does more business process states than the ckan core's states and
private choices. Process states match to state and private choices in N to 1 cardinality.
It allows more situations to fit the usage in deep. The match is like below:

    Process_state     state     private
    Draft             draft     true
    Modified          active    true
    Submitted         active    true
    Pending           active    true
    Rejected          active    true
    Approved          active    false
